# Action items for this module

- constants that might be useful cross-module. Not sure if that is even necessary
- ~~Documentation~~ MORE documentation
- ~~Tests~~ MORE Tests
- Quality control on the hashmap keys is desperately needed. Some common-sense key pairs (ie "foot" and "meter") do not exist except with qualifying information in parenthesis. This should definitely not be the case for very common unit conversions.
